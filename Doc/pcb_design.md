# PCB design

The enclosure is designed as a stack of 7 PCBs held together by six brass standoffs and 12 M2 flat-head screws. The PCBs, from bottom to top, are: 

## Keyboard PCB

This 0.8mm-thick aluminium PCB houses keyboard switches, a 2016 battery cell holder and a flex cable connector. At the same time, it serves as the back lid for the enclosure.

## Spacer 1

1.6mm-thick FR4 PCB, which serves as a frame for the enclosure, and panelised key caps to be separated during the assembly.

## Spacer 2

0.8mm-thick FR4 PCB, a frame for the enclosure, and panelised key pads.

## MCU PCB

The main PCB (0.8mm-thick, FR4), which houses most of the electronics. The two separated panels ("B" and "C") at the bottom are parts of the jig to solder the key caps.

## Spacer 3

A spacer between the main PCB and the front panel, 1.4mm-think FR4 PCB. The panels "A" and "D" are other parts of the key caps jig.

## Frame

0.8mm-thick aluminium PCB, which serves as a frame to hold the LCD and to surround the keyboard to avoid spurious key presses.
