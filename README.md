# OpenRPNCalc
Open-source and open-hardware scientific RPN calculator

## Introduction

OpenRPNCalc is a scientific calculator based on STM32 microcontroller. Its source code, schematics and 3D-printed case design files are released under open license. 

The hardware is inspired by the SwissMicros DM42 calculator, but designed from scratch. Firmware-wise, however, there is no intention to simulate programmable HP series. Currently, the calulator features: 

  * Reverse Polish notation with 4-element stack. 
  * Double-precision arithmetics. 
  * "Standard" scientific calculator functions (trigonometric, logarighms, exponentiation, square root and power). 
  * Error function (erf) and its inverse (erfinv). 
  * Fixed, scientific (SCI) and engineering (ENG) display modes (including SI prefixes in ENG mode), variable 3-10 digits precision. 
  * Calculations with uncertainties (UNCERT mode).
