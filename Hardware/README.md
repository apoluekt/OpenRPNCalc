# Hardware design files

Contents of this folder: 

* PCBs: KiCad design files (schematic and PCBs) for all sevel layers. Where appropriate, python files used to produce silkscreen labels, place components and make edge cuts are also provided.
* production: Production files created in KiCad (Gerber files, BOM, assembly positions). These can normally be submitted to the PCB prototyping service without modifications.
